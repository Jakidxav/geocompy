In this context, we define map algebra more narrowly, as operations that modify or summarise raster cell values, with reference to surrounding cells, zones, or statistical functions that apply to every cell.\n",

        "Map algebra operations tend to be fast, because raster datasets only implicitly store coordinates, hence the old adage \"raster is faster but vector is corrector\". The location of cells in raster datasets can be calculated by using its matrix position and the resolution and origin of the dataset (stored in the header). For the processing, however, the geographic position of a cell is barely relevant as long as we make sure that the cell position is still the same after the processing. Additionally, if two or more raster datasets share the same extent, projection and resolution, one could treat them as matrices for the processing.\n",
        "\n",
        "This is the way that map algebra works with the terra package. First, the headers of the raster datasets are queried and (in cases where map algebra operations work on more than one dataset) checked to ensure the datasets are compatible. Second, map algebra retains the so-called one-to-one locational correspondence, meaning that cells cannot move. This differs from matrix algebra, in which values change position, for example when multiplying or dividing matrices.\n",

Computing a distance raster (global operation) while only considering a maximum distance (logical focal operation) is the equivalent to a vector buffer operation (@sec-buffers). Reclassifying raster data (either local or zonal function depending on the input) is equivalent to dissolving vector data (Section @sec-geometry-unions). Overlaying two rasters (local operation), where one contains \"No Data\" values representing a mask, is similar to vector clipping (Section @sec-clipping). Quite similar to spatial clipping is intersecting two layers (Section @sec-spatial-subsetting). The difference is that these two layers (vector or raster) simply share an overlapping area. However, be careful with the wording. Sometimes the same words have slightly different meanings for raster and vector data models. While aggregating polygon geometries means dissolving boundaries, for raster data geometries it means increasing cell sizes and thereby reducing spatial resolution. Zonal operations dissolve the cells of one raster in accordance with the zones (categories) of another raster dataset using an aggregating function.\n",
