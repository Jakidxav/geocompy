        "\n",
        "This chapter is about reading and writing geographic data.\n",
        "Geographic data input is essential for geocomputation: real-world applications are impossible without data.\n",
        "Data output is also vital, enabling others to use valuable new or improved datasets resulting from your work.\n",
        "Taken together, these processes of input/output can be referred to as data I/O.\n",
        "\n",
        "Geographic data I/O is often done with few lines of code at the beginning and end of projects.\n",
        "It is often overlooked as a simple one step process.\n",
        "However, mistakes made at the outset of projects (e.g., using an out-of-date or in some way faulty dataset) can lead to large problems later down the line, so it is worth putting considerable time into identifying which datasets are available, where they can be found and how to retrieve them.\n",
        "These topics are covered in @sec-retrieving-open-data, which describes various geoportals, which collectively contain many terabytes of data, and how to use them.\n",
        "To further ease data access, a number of packages for downloading geographic data have been developed, as described in @sec-geographic-data-packages.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are many geographic file formats, each of which has pros and cons, described in @sec-file-formats.\n",
        "The process of reading and writing files efficiently is covered in Sections @sec-data-input and @sec-data-output, respectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Retrieving open data {#sec-retrieving-open-data}\n",
        "\n",
        "A vast and ever-increasing amount of geographic data is available on the internet, much of which is free to access and use (with appropriate credit given to its providers).[^07-read-write-plot-1]\n",
        "In some ways there is now too much data, in the sense that there are often multiple places to access the same dataset.\n",
        "Some datasets are of poor quality.\n",
        "In this context, it is vital to know where to look, so the first section covers some of the most important sources.\n",
        "Various 'geoportals' (web services providing geospatial datasets such as [Data.gov](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset?metadata_type=geospatial)) are a good place to start, providing a wide range of data but often only for specific locations (as illustrated in the updated [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoportal) on the topic).\n",
        "\n",
        "[^07-read-write-plot-1]: For example, visit <https://freegisdata.rtwilson.com/> for a vast list of websites with freely available geographic datasets.\n",
        "\n",
        "Some global geoportals overcome this issue.\n",
        "The [GEOSS portal](http://www.geoportal.org/) and the [Copernicus Open Access Hub](https://scihub.copernicus.eu/), for example, contain many raster datasets with global coverage.\n",
        "A wealth of vector datasets can be accessed from the [SEDAC](http://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/) portal run by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the European Union's [INSPIRE geoportal](http://inspire-geoportal.ec.europa.eu/), with global and regional coverage.\n",
        "\n",
        "Most geoportals provide a graphical interface allowing datasets to be queried based on characteristics such as spatial and temporal extent, the United States Geological Survey's [EarthExplorer](https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/) being a prime example.\n",
        "Exploring datasets interactively on a browser is an effective way of understanding available layers.\n",
        "From reproducibility and efficiency perspectives, downloading data is, however, best done with code.\n",
        "Downloads can be initiated from the command line using a variety of techniques, primarily via URLs and APIs (see the [Sentinel API](https://scihub.copernicus.eu/twiki/do/view/SciHubWebPortal/APIHubDescription), for example).\n",
        "Files hosted on static URLs can be downloaded with the following method, as illustrated in the code chunk below which accesses the [Natural Earth Data](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/) website to download the world airports layer zip file and to extract the contained ESRI Shapefile.\n",
        "Note that the download code is complicated by the fact that the server checks the `User-agent` header of the request, basically to make sure that the download takes place through a browser.\n",
        "To overcome this, we add a header corresponding to a request coming from a browser (such as Firefox) in our code.\n",
        "<!-- jn: the following code example looks fairly complex (I think it can be done with download.file only in R) -- cannot we simplify it somehow? -->\n",
        "<!-- md: I tried another solution (wget.download) but it requires the same workaround of user-agent (and also it is a third-party package which is less preferable), so I don't see how the code can be simplified. Right, in R download file doesn't require user-agent in this case, the \"download\" part of the code would be 1 expression instead of 4 in Python -->\n"
