  This book will teach you how to work with geographic data in Python.
  It's a short and practical open source book in which you'll
  develop and use geocomputation to solve practical
  problems and lay the foundations for advanced geospatial applications.

## Reproducing this book

An important aspect of scientific research that results can be independently verified by others.
Information that is generated by scientific means does not on auguments of authority or other [logical fallacies](https://bookofbadarguments.com/) as the basis for belief.
Instead science relies on a network of people who are open minded yet skeptical to test assumptions and in some cases 'bust myths'.

In the digital age, trust in claims depends on computational reproducibility.

### Local with Quarto

To run the code locally, recommended for using the material on real data, you need to have a reasonable computer, e.g., with 8 GB RAM.
You'll need administrative rights to install the requirements, which include:

- A suitable integrated development environment (IDE) such as VS Code, RStudio or Jupyter Notebook
- Quarto, if you want to reproduce the book's open access website
- Either an Anaconda-like environment (we recommend `miniconda3`) or Docker to get systems dependencies

See the [project's README](https://github.com/geocompr/py) for details on getting set-up.
After you have installed the necessary dependencies and cloned or [unzipped](https://github.com/geocompr/py/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) the book's source code, you should be able to reproduce the code in its entirety with the following command:

```bash
quarto preview
```

If you see output like that below (with the IDE and browser arranged to see live updates after editing the source code), congratulations, it has worked!

### Local with Jupyter

Alternatively, you can [download](https://github.com/geocompr/py/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and unzip the book's source code. The unzipped directory `py-main/code/chapters/` contains:

* The source `ipynb` files, one for each chapter
* The `data` sub-directory with the sample data used in the code sections

Assuming that all required packages are installed (see beginning of each chapter), you can execute the `ipynb` files through your chosen working environment (VScode, Jupyter Notebook, etc.).
