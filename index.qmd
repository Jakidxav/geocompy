This is site contains ideas, code and an outline of a yet-to-be written book on *Geocomputation with Python*.

## Motivations

This book, tentatively called Geocomputation with Python ('geocompy'), is motivated by the need for an introductory yet rigorous and up-to-date resource on working with geographic data in Python that demonstrates basic data structures and describes code for handling vector *and* raster datasets in an integrated way.
There are many resources on Python packages for geographic research and various applications but, to the best of our knowledge, no other resource brings together the following features into a single home:

1. Small introductory textbook focuses on doing basic operations well
2. Integration of vector and raster datasets in the same book, and within each section
3. Clear explanation of the code and exercises to maximize learning for newcomers
4. Provision of lucid example datasets and meaningful operations to illustrate the applied nature of geographic research

The book aims to supplement other resources in the ecosystem, as highlighted by comparison with the book's scope with existing and in-progress works:

- [Learning Geospatial Analysis with Python](https://www.packtpub.com/product/learning-geospatial-analysis-with-python/9781783281138) and [Geoprocessing with Python](https://www.manning.com/books/geoprocessing-with-python) focuses on processing spatial data using low-level Python interfaces for GDAL, such as the `gdal`, `gdalnumeric`, and `ogr` [packages](https://gdal.org/api/python.html) from `osgeo`. 
This approach is more complex, [less "Pythonic"](https://rasterio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html#philosophy), and perhaps outdated in light of development of packages such as `geopandas` and `rasterio` covered here
- [pythongis.org](https://pythongis.org/) (at an early stage of development) seeks to provide a general introduction to 'GIS in Python', with parts focusing on Python essentials, using Python with GIS, and case studies. 
Compared with pythongis.org, geocompy has a relatively narrow scope (1) and a greater focus on raster-vector interoperability
- [geographicdata.science](https://geographicdata.science/book/intro.html) is an ambitious project with chapters dedicated to advanced topics, with Chapter 4 on [Spatial Weights](https://geographicdata.science/book/notebooks/04_spatial_weights.html) getting into complex topics relatively early, for example.
Geocompy would be shorter, simpler and more introductory, and cover raster and vector data with equal importance (1 to 4)

Geocompy is a sister project of [Geocomputation with R](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/) -- a book on geographic data analysis, visualization, and modeling using the R programming language.

## Reproducing this book
<!-- Would this live better in the README (RL 2022-02-16) -->

An important aspect of scientific research and 'citizen science' that is participatory is reproducibility of results.
We aim to make this web version of the book as easy as possible. See the source code for details (work in progress).

### Reproduce the book locally

To reproduce the book locally, run the following commands:

```bash
# Todo add content

```


### Reproduce the book in a Docker container with VSCode IDE

Todo: help wanted

### Reproduce the book in a Docker container with IPython notebook

Todo: help wanted

### Reproduce the book in a Docker container with RStudio IDE

```bash
docker pull geocompr/geocompr:python
docker run --rm -d -p 8784:8787 -e DISABLE_AUTH=TRUE --name geocompy \
  -v $(pwd):/home/rstudio/pytest geocompr/geocompr:python
firefox localhost:8784 # or your browser of choice
```

After opening the relevant project running `quarto preview` in the system shell in browser-based IDE opened by the command above, you should see something like this where you can run code and even modify the book and see changes with the previou command.

### Reproduce the book in Binder

Todo: help wanted

```{bash, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# Todo: improve these instructions before showing these system commands
# To reproduce the book you need Python and and geo packages installed
# Install them through a framework such as Conda (recommended) or pip3 as follows:
pip3 install geopandas rasterio rioxarray jupyter matplotlib netcdf4 h5netcdf 
# install quarto...
quarto preview

# Run the book code on Docker:
```
