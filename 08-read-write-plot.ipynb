        "\n",
        "This chapter is about reading and writing geographic data.\n",
        "Geographic data import is essential for geocomputation: real-world applications are impossible without data. \n",
        "Data output is also vital, enabling others to use valuable new or improved datasets resulting from your work. \n",
        "Taken together, these processes of import/output can be referred to as data I/O.\n",
        "\n",
        "Geographic data I/O is often done with few lines of code at the beginning and end of projects. \n",
        "It is often overlooked as a simple one step process. \n",
        "However, mistakes made at the outset of projects (e.g. using an out-of-date or in some way faulty dataset) can lead to large problems later down the line, so it is worth putting considerable time into identifying which datasets are available, where they can be found and how to retrieve them. \n",
        "These topics are covered in @sec-retrieving-open-data, which describes various geoportals, which collectively contain many terabytes of data, and how to use them. \n",
        "To further ease data access, a number of packages for downloading geographic data have been developed, as described in @sec-geographic-data-packages.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are many geographic file formats, each of which has pros and cons, described in @sec-file-formats. \n",
        "The process of reading and writing files in formats efficiently is covered in Sections @sec-data-input and @sec-data-output, respectively. \n",
        "The final Section @sec-visual-outputs demonstrates methods for saving visual outputs (maps), in preparation for @sec-map-making on visualization.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Retrieving open data {#sec-retrieving-open-data}\n",
        "\n",
        "A vast and ever-increasing amount of geographic data is available on the internet, much of which is free to access and use (with appropriate credit given to its providers).[^gis-open-datasets]\n",
        "In some ways there is now too much data, in the sense that there are often multiple places to access the same dataset. \n",
        "Some datasets are of poor quality. \n",
        "In this context, it is vital to know where to look, so the first section covers some of the most important sources. \n",
        "Various 'geoportals' (web services providing geospatial datasets such as [Data.gov](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset?metadata_type=geospatial)) are a good place to start, providing a wide range of data but often only for specific locations (as illustrated in the updated [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoportal) on the topic).\n",
        "\n",
        "[^gis-open-datasets]: For example, visit <https://freegisdata.rtwilson.com/> for a list of websites with freely available geographic datasets.\n",
        "\n",
        "Some global geoportals overcome this issue. \n",
        "The [GEOSS portal](http://www.geoportal.org/) and the [Copernicus Open Access Hub](https://scihub.copernicus.eu/), for example, contain many raster datasets with global coverage. \n",
        "A wealth of vector datasets can be accessed from the [SEDAC](http://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/) portal run by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the European Union's [INSPIRE geoportal](http://inspire-geoportal.ec.europa.eu/), with global and regional coverage.\n",
        "\n",
        "Most geoportals provide a graphical interface allowing datasets to be queried based on characteristics such as spatial and temporal extent, the United States Geological Survey's [EarthExplorer](https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/) being a prime example. \n",
        "Exploring datasets interactively on a browser is an effective way of understanding available layers. \n",
        "Downloading data is best done with code, however, from reproducibility and efficiency perspectives. \n",
        "Downloads can be initiated from the command line using a variety of techniques, primarily via URLs and APIs (see the [Sentinel API](https://scihub.copernicus.eu/twiki/do/view/SciHubWebPortal/APIHubDescription) for example). \n",
        "Files hosted on static URLs can be downloaded with the following method, as illustrated in the code chunk below which accesses the [Natural Earth Data](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/) website to download the world airports layer zip file and to extract the contained Shapefile. \n",
        "Note that the download code is complicated by the fact that the server checks the `User-agent` header of the request, basically to make sure that the download takes place through a browser. \n",
        "To overcome this, we add a header corresponding to a request coming from a browser (such as Firefox) in our code:\n"

        "ESRI Shapefile is the most popular vector data exchange format; however, it is not an open format (though its specification is open). \n",

        "First of all, it is a multi-file format, which consists of at least three files. \n",
        "It only supports 255 columns, column names are restricted to ten characters and the file size limit is 2 GB. \n",
        "Furthermore, ESRI Shapefile does not support all possible geometry types, for example, it is unable to distinguish between a polygon and a multipolygon. \n",
        "Despite these limitations, a viable alternative had been missing for a long time. \n",
        "In the meantime, [GeoPackage](https://www.geopackage.org/) emerged, and seems to be a more than suitable replacement candidate for ESRI Shapefile. \n",
        "GeoPackage is a format for exchanging geospatial information and an OGC standard. \n",
        "The GeoPackage standard describes the rules on how to store geospatial information in a tiny SQLite container. \n",
        "Hence, GeoPackage is a lightweight spatial database container, which allows the storage of vector and raster data but also of non-spatial data and extensions. \n",
        "Aside from GeoPackage, there are other geospatial data exchange formats worth checking out (@tbl-file-formats).\n",
        "\n",
        "The GeoTIFF format seems to be the most prominent raster data format. \n",
        "It allows spatial information, such as the CRS definition and the transformation matrix (see @sec-using-rasterio), to be embedded within a TIFF file. \n",
        "Similar to ESRI Shapefile, this format was firstly developed in the 1990s, but as an open format. \n",
        "Additionally, GeoTIFF is still being expanded and improved. \n",
        "One of the most significant recent addition to the GeoTIFF format is its variant called COG (Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF). \n",
        "Raster objects saved as COGs can be hosted on HTTP servers, so other people can read only parts of the file without downloading the whole file (see Sections 8.6.2 and 8.7.2...).\n",
        "\n",
        "There is also a plethora of other spatial data formats that we do not explain in detail or mention in @tbl-file-formats due to the book limits. \n",
        "If you need to use other formats, we encourage you to read the GDAL documentation about [vector](https://gdal.org/drivers/vector/index.html) and [raster](https://gdal.org/drivers/raster/index.html) drivers. \n",
        "Additionally, some spatial data formats can store other data models (types) than vector or raster. \n",
        "It includes LAS and LAZ formats for storing lidar point clouds, and NetCDF and HDF for storing multidimensional arrays.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, spatial data is also often stored using tabular (non-spatial) text formats, including CSV files or Excel spreadsheets. \n",

If there are several bands we may execute the `.write` method several times, as in `.write(a,n)`, where `a` is the array with band values and `n` is the band index (starting from `1`, see below). When done, we close the file connection using the `.close` method. Some functions, such as `rasterio.warp.reproject` used for resampling and reprojecting, directly accept a file connection in `'w'` mode, thus handling the writing (of a resampled or reprojected raster) for us.\n",

The most complicated property is the `transform`, which specifies the raster origin and resolution. The `transform` is typically either obtained from an existing raster (serving as a \"template\"), or created from scratch based on manually specified origin and resolution values (e.g., using `rasterio.transform.from_origin`), or calculate automatically (e.g., using `rasterio.warp.calculate_default_transform`).\n",
