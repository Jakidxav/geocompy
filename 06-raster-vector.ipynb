Often the extent of input raster datasets is larger than the area of interest. In this case raster **cropping** and **masking** are useful for unifying the spatial extent of input data. Both operations reduce object memory use and associated computational resources for subsequent analysis steps, and may be a necessary preprocessing step before creating attractive maps involving raster data.\n",
