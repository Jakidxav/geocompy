# Geographic data I/O {#read-write}

## Introduction

This chapter is about reading and writing geographic data. Geographic data import is essential for geocomputation: real-world applications are impossible without data. 
Data output is also vital, enabling others to use valuable new or improved datasets resulting from your work. 
Taken together, these processes of import/output can be referred to as data I/O.

Geographic data I/O is often done with few lines of code at the beginning and end of projects. 
It is often overlooked as a simple one step process. 
However, mistakes made at the outset of projects (e.g. using an out-of-date or in some way faulty dataset) can lead to large problems later down the line, so it is worth putting considerable time into identifying which datasets are available, where they can be found and how to retrieve them. 
These topics are covered in @sec-retrieving-open-data, which describes various geoportals, which collectively contain many terabytes of data, and how to use them. 
To further ease data access, a number of packages for downloading geographic data have been developed. 
These are described in @sec-geographic-data-packages.

There are many geographic file formats, each of which has pros and cons. 
These are described in @sec-file-formats. 
The process of actually reading and writing such file formats efficiently is not covered until Sections @sec-data-input and @sec-data-output, respectively. 
The final Section @sec-visual-outputs demonstrates methods for saving visual outputs (maps), in preparation for @sec-map-making on visualization.
