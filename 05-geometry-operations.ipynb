        "So far the book has explained the structure of geographic datasets (Chapter 2), and how to manipulate them based on their non-geographic attributes (Chapter 3) and spatial relations (Chapter 4). \n",
        "This chapter focusses on manipulating the geographic elements of geographic objects, for example by simplifying and converting vector geometries, cropping raster datasets, and converting vector objects into rasters and from rasters into vectors. \n",
        "After reading it---and attempting the exercises at the end---you should understand and have control over the geometry column in vector layers and the extent and geographic location of pixels represented in rasters in relation to other geographic objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "@sec-geo-vec covers transforming vector geometries with 'unary' and 'binary' operations. Unary operations work on a single geometry in isolation, including simplification (of lines and polygons), the creation of buffers and centroids, and shifting/scaling/rotating single geometries using 'affine transformations' (@sec-simplification to @sec-affine-transformations). Binary transformations modify one geometry based on the shape of another, including clipping and geometry unions, covered in @sec-clipping and @sec-geometry-unions, respectively. Type transformations (from a polygon to a line, for example) are demonstrated in Section @sec-type-transformations.\n",
        "\n",
        "@sec-geo-ras covers geometric transformations on raster objects. This involves changing the size and number of the underlying pixels, and assigning them new values. It teaches how to change the resolution (also called raster aggregation and disaggregation), the extent and the origin of a raster. These operations are especially useful if one would like to align raster datasets from diverse sources. Aligned raster objects share a one-to-one correspondence between pixels, allowing them to be processed using map algebra operations, described in Section 4.3.2. The final Section 6 connects vector and raster objects. It shows how raster values can be 'masked' and 'extracted' by vector geometries. Importantly it shows how to 'polygonize' rasters and 'rasterize' vector datasets, making the two data models more interchangeable.\n",

It is more advanced than the spatial data operations presented in the previous chapter (in @sec-spatial-vec), because here we drill down into the geometry: the functions discussed in this section work on the geometric (`GeoSeries`) part, either as standalone object or as part of a `GeoDataFrame`.\n",

Another reason for simplifying objects is to reduce the amount of memory, disk space and network bandwidth they consume: it may be wise to simplify complex geometries before publishing them as interactive maps. The `geopandas` package provides the `.simplify` method, which uses the GEOS implementation of the Douglas-Peucker algorithm to reduce the vertex count. `.simplify` uses the `tolerance` to control the level of generalization in map units (see Douglas and Peucker 1973 for details). \n",

        "A limitation with `.simplify` is that it simplifies objects on a per-geometry basis. This means the \"topology\" is lost, resulting in overlapping and \"holey\" areal units illustrated in Figure @fig-simplify-polygons (middle panel). The `toposimplify` function from `topojson` provides an alternative that overcomes this issue. By [default](https://mattijn.github.io/topojson/example/settings-tuning.html#simplify_algorithm) it uses the Douglas-Peucker algorithm like the `.simplify` method. Another algorithm known as Visvalingam-Whyatt, which overcomes some limitations of the Douglas-Peucker algorithm (Visvalingam and Whyatt 1993), is also available in `toposimplify`. The main advanatage of `toposimplify`, however, is that it is topologically \"aware\". That is, it simplifies the combined borders of the polygons (rather than each polygon on its own), thus ensuring that the overlap is maintained.

Used for continuous rasters and results in a smoother surface compared to bilinear interpolation, but is computationally more demanding.\n",
        "* Cubic spline interpolation: also uses values of the 16 nearest cells of the original raster to determine the output cell value, but applies cubic splines (piecewise third-order polynomial functions). Used for continuous rasters.\n",
        "* Lanczos windowed sinc resampling: uses values of the 36 nearest cells of the original raster to determine the output cell value. Used for continuous rasters.\n",

        "In other words, reprojection is *resampling* into a grid that is in a different CRS. We will demonstrate reprojection using `rasterio.warp.reproject` later on (@sec-reprojecting-raster-geometries). \n",
