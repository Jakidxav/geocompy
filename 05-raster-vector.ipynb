        "* raster cropping and masking using vector objects (@sec-raster-cropping), \n",
        "* extracting raster values using different types of vector data (Section @sec-raster-extraction), and \n",
        "* raster-vector conversion (@sec-rasterization and @sec-spatial-vectorization).\n",
        "\n",
        "These concepts are demonstrated using data from in previous chapters, to understand their potential real-world applications.\n",

        "\n",
        "Many geographic data projects involve integrating data from many different sources, such as remote sensing images (rasters) and administrative boundaries (vectors). \n",
        "Often the extent of input raster datasets is larger than the area of interest. \n",
        "In this case raster *masking*, *cropping*, or both, are useful for unifying the spatial extent of input data (@fig-raster-crop (b) and (c), and the following two examples, illustrate the difference between masking and cropping). \n",
        "Both operations reduce object memory use and associated computational resources for subsequent analysis steps, and may be a necessary preprocessing step before creating attractive maps involving raster data.\n",
        "\n",
        "We will use two layers to illustrate raster cropping:\n",
        "\n",
        "* The `srtm.tif` raster representing elevation (meters above sea level) in south-western Utah (a **rasterio** file connection named `src_srtm`) (see @fig-raster-crop (a))\n",
        "* The `zion.gpkg` vector layer representing the Zion National Park boundaries (a `GeoDataFrame` named `zion`)\n",
        "\n",
        "Both target and cropping objects must have the same projection. \n",
        "Since it is easier and more precise to reproject vector layers, compared to rasters, we use the following expression to reproject the vector layer `zion` into the CRS of the raster `src_srtm`:\n"

In case we have an existing template raster, we simply need to query its `out_shape` and `transform`.
