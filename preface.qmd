## Preface {.unnumbered}

**Geocomputation with Python** (*geocompy*), is motivated by the need for an introductory yet rigorous and up-to-date resource geographic data with Python.
A key feature of the book is that it that demonstrates code for working with *both vector and raster* geographic data types in an integrated way.
Chapters contain examples *both* with point, line, polygon geometries alongside example datasets in the matrix-based raster data model.

There are many resources on Python for geographic research but, to the best of our knowledge, no other resource brings together the following features into a single home:

1. Small introductory textbook focuses on doing basic operations well
2. Integration of vector and raster datasets in the same book, and within each section
3. Clear explanation of the code and exercises to maximize learning for newcomers
4. Provision of lucid example datasets and meaningful operations to illustrate the applied nature of geographic research

The book aims to supplement other resources in the ecosystem, as highlighted by comparison with the book's scope with existing and in-progress works:

- [Learning Geospatial Analysis with Python](https://www.packtpub.com/product/learning-geospatial-analysis-with-python/9781783281138) and [Geoprocessing with Python](https://www.manning.com/books/geoprocessing-with-python) focuses on processing spatial data using low-level Python interfaces for GDAL, such as the `gdal`, `gdalnumeric`, and `ogr` [packages](https://gdal.org/api/python.html) from `osgeo`. 
This approach is more complex, [less "Pythonic"](https://rasterio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html#philosophy), and perhaps outdated in light of development of packages such as `geopandas` and `rasterio` covered here
- [Introduction to Python for Geographic Data Analysis](https://pythongis.org/) (at an early stage of development) seeks to provide a general introduction to 'GIS in Python', with parts focusing on Python essentials, using Python with GIS, and case studies. 
Compared with pythongis.org, geocompy has a relatively narrow scope (1) and a greater focus on raster-vector interoperability
- [Geographic Data Science with Python](https://geographicdata.science/book/intro.html) is an ambitious project with chapters dedicated to advanced topics, with Chapter 4 on [Spatial Weights](https://geographicdata.science/book/notebooks/04_spatial_weights.html) getting into complex topics relatively early, for example.
Geocompy would be shorter, simpler and more introductory, and cover raster and vector data with equal importance (1 to 4)

Geocompy is a sister project of [Geocomputation with R](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/) -- a book on geographic data analysis, visualization, and modeling using the R programming language.
