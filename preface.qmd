## Preface {.unnumbered}

**Geocomputation with Python** (*geocompy*), is motivated by the need for an introductory yet rigorous and up-to-date resource geographic data with the most popular programming language in the world.
A unique selling point of the book its cohesive and joined-up coverage of *both vector and raster* geographic data models and consistent learning curve.
We aim to *minimize surprises*, with each section and chapter building on the previous.
If you're just starting out with Python for working with geographic data, this book is an excellent place to start.

There are many resources on Python on 'GeoPython' but none that fill this need for an introductory resource that provides strong foundations for future work.
We want to avoid reinventing the wheel and provide something that fills an 'ecological niche' in the wider free and open source software for geospatial (FOSS4G) ecosystem.
Key features include:

1. Doing basic operations well
2. Integration of vector and raster datasets and operations
3. Clear explanation of each line of code in the book to minimize surprises
4. Excersises at the end of each chapter with reproducible and open solutions
5. Provision of lucid example datasets and meaningful operations to illustrate the applied nature of geographic research

The book aims to supplement other resources in the ecosystem, as highlighted by comparison with the book's scope with existing and in-progress works:

- [Learning Geospatial Analysis with Python](https://www.packtpub.com/product/learning-geospatial-analysis-with-python/9781783281138) and [Geoprocessing with Python](https://www.manning.com/books/geoprocessing-with-python) focuses on processing spatial data using low-level Python interfaces for GDAL, such as the `gdal`, `gdalnumeric`, and `ogr` [packages](https://gdal.org/api/python.html) from `osgeo`. 
This approach is more complex, [less "Pythonic"](https://rasterio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html#philosophy), and perhaps outdated in light of development of packages such as `geopandas` and `rasterio` covered here
- [Introduction to Python for Geographic Data Analysis](https://pythongis.org/) (at an early stage of development) seeks to provide a general introduction to 'GIS in Python', with parts focusing on Python essentials, using Python with GIS, and case studies. 
Compared with pythongis.org, geocompy has a relatively narrow scope (1) and a greater focus on raster-vector interoperability
- [Geographic Data Science with Python](https://geographicdata.science/book/intro.html) is an ambitious project with chapters dedicated to advanced topics, with Chapter 4 on [Spatial Weights](https://geographicdata.science/book/notebooks/04_spatial_weights.html) getting into complex topics relatively early, for example.
Geocompy would be shorter, simpler and more introductory, and cover raster and vector data with equal importance (1 to 4)

Geocompy is a sister project of [Geocomputation with R](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/) -- a book on geographic data analysis, visualization, and modeling using the R programming language.
