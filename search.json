    "text": "1.1 Motivations\nThis book, tentatively called Geocomputation with Python (‘geocompy’), is motivated by the need for an introductory yet rigorous and up-to-date resource on working with geographic data in Python that demonstrates basic data structures and describes code for handling vector and raster datasets in an integrated way. There are many resources on Python packages for geographic research and various applications but, to the best of our knowledge, no other resource brings together the following features into a single home:\n\nSmall introductory textbook focuses on doing basic operations well\nIntegration of vector and raster datasets in the same book, and within each section\nClear explanation of the code and exercises to maximize learning for newcomers\nProvision of lucid example datasets and meaningful operations to illustrate the applied nature of geographic research\n\nThe book aims to supplement other resources in the ecosystem, as highlighted by comparison with the book’s scope with existing and in-progress works:\n\n\nLearning Geospatial Analysis with Python and Geoprocessing with Python focuses on processing spatial data using low-level Python interfaces for GDAL, such as the gdal, gdalnumeric, and ogr packages from osgeo. This approach is more complex, less “Pythonic”, and perhaps outdated in light of development of packages such as geopandas and rasterio covered here\n\npythongis.org (at an early stage of development) seeks to provide a general introduction to ‘GIS in Python’, with parts focusing on Python essentials, using Python with GIS, and case studies. Compared with pythongis.org, geocompy has a relatively narrow scope (1) and a greater focus on raster-vector interoperability\n\ngeographicdata.science is an ambitious project with chapters dedicated to advanced topics, with Chapter 4 on Spatial Weights getting into complex topics relatively early, for example. Geocompy would be shorter, simpler and more introductory, and cover raster and vector data with equal importance (1 to 4)\n\nGeocompy is a sister project of Geocomputation with R – a book on geographic data analysis, visualization, and modeling using the R programming language."

    "text": "2.2 Vector data\n\n2.2.1 Introduction\nWhen introducing the packages for working with vector layers in Python, we are going to go from the complex class (vector layer), through the intermediate (geometry column), to the simple (geometry). As we will see, the three classes are hierarchical, meaning that the complex encompasses the simple:\n\nA vector layer (class GeoDataFrame) contains a geometry column (class GeoSeries) as one of the columns\nA geometry column (class GeoSeries) is composed of individual geometries (class shapely)\n\nThe first two classes (GeoDataFrame and GeoSeries) are defined in package geopandas. The third class is defined in package shapely, which deals with individual geometries, and comprises on of the dependencies of the geopandas package.\n\n\n2.2.2 Vector layers\nThe typical data structure for vector data is a vector layer. There are several methods to work with vector layers in Python, ranging from low-level (e.g., fiona) to high-level (geopandas). In this book, we focus on geopandas.\nBefore we begin, we need to import the geopandas package, conventionally as gpd:\n\nimport geopandas as gpd\n\nWe will also limit the maximum number of printed rows to four, to save space, using the \"display.max_rows\" option of pandas:\n\nimport pandas as pd\npd.set_option(\"display.max_rows\", 4)\n\nMost often, we import an existing vector layer from a file, such as a Shapefile or a GeoPackage file.\n\ndat = gpd.read_file(\"data/world.gpkg\")\n\nThe result is a GeoDataFrame:\n\ntype(dat)\n\ngeopandas.geodataframe.GeoDataFrame\n\n\nThe GeoDataFrame class is an extension of the DataFrame class. Thus, we can treat a vector layer as a table and process it using the ordinary, i.e., non-spatial, pandas methods. For example, the following expression creates a subset with just the country name and the geometry (see below):\n\ndat = dat[[\"name_long\", \"geometry\"]]\ndat\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      name_long\n      geometry\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      Fiji\n      MULTIPOLYGON (((-180.00000 -16.55522, -179.917...\n    \n    \n      1\n      Tanzania\n      MULTIPOLYGON (((33.90371 -0.95000, 31.86617 -1...\n    \n    \n      ...\n      ...\n      ...\n    \n    \n      175\n      Trinidad and Tobago\n      MULTIPOLYGON (((-61.68000 10.76000, -61.66000 ...\n    \n    \n      176\n      South Sudan\n      MULTIPOLYGON (((30.83385 3.50917, 31.24556 3.7...\n    \n  \n\n177 rows × 2 columns\n\n\n\nThe following expression creates a subset based on a condition, including just \"Egypt\":\n\ndat[dat[\"name_long\"] == \"Egypt\"]\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      name_long\n      geometry\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      163\n      Egypt\n      MULTIPOLYGON (((36.86623 22.00000, 36.69069 22...\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\nFinally, to get a sense of the spatial component of the vector layer, it can be plotted using the .plot method, as follows:\n\ndat.plot();\n\n\n\n\n\n# Todo: eval when fixed\nimport \nlot.pandas\ndat.hvplot()\n\n\n\n2.2.3 Geometry columns\nOne of the columns in a GeoDataFrame is a geometry column, of class GeoSeries. The geometry column contains the geometric part of the vector layer, e.g., the POLYGON or MULTIPOLYGON geometries of the 177 countries in dat:\n\ndat[\"geometry\"]\n\n0      MULTIPOLYGON (((-180.00000 -16.55522, -179.917...\n1      MULTIPOLYGON (((33.90371 -0.95000, 31.86617 -1...\n                             ...                        \n175    MULTIPOLYGON (((-61.68000 10.76000, -61.66000 ...\n176    MULTIPOLYGON (((30.83385 3.50917, 31.24556 3.7...\nName: geometry, Length: 177, dtype: geometry\n\n\nThe geometry column also contains the spatial reference information, if any (see below).\nMany of the spatial operators, such as calculating the centroid, buffer, or bounding box of each feature, in fact involve just the geometry. Therefore, for example, the following expressions give exactly the same result, a GeoSeries with country bounding boxes:\n\ndat.bounds\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      minx\n      miny\n      maxx\n      maxy\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      -180.000000\n      -18.287990\n      179.999990\n      -16.020882\n    \n    \n      1\n      29.339998\n      -11.720938\n      40.316590\n      -0.950000\n    \n    \n      ...\n      ...\n      ...\n      ...\n      ...\n    \n    \n      175\n      -61.950000\n      10.000000\n      -60.895000\n      10.890000\n    \n    \n      176\n      23.886980\n      3.509172\n      35.298007\n      12.248008\n    \n  \n\n177 rows × 4 columns\n\n\n\n\ndat[\"geometry\"].bounds\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      minx\n      miny\n      maxx\n      maxy\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      -180.000000\n      -18.287990\n      179.999990\n      -16.020882\n    \n    \n      1\n      29.339998\n      -11.720938\n      40.316590\n      -0.950000\n    \n    \n      ...\n      ...\n      ...\n      ...\n      ...\n    \n    \n      175\n      -61.950000\n      10.000000\n      -60.895000\n      10.890000\n    \n    \n      176\n      23.886980\n      3.509172\n      35.298007\n      12.248008\n    \n  \n\n177 rows × 4 columns\n\n\n\nAnother useful property of the geometry column is the geometry type (see below). Note that the types of geometries contained in a geometry column (and, thus, a vector layer) are not necessarily the same. Accordingly, the .type property returns a Series (of type string), rather than a single value:\n\ndat[\"geometry\"].type\n\n0      MultiPolygon\n1      MultiPolygon\n           ...     \n175    MultiPolygon\n176    MultiPolygon\nLength: 177, dtype: object\n\n\nTo summarize the occurrence of different geometry types in a geometry column, we can use the pandas method called value_counts:\n\ndat[\"geometry\"].type.value_counts()\n\nMultiPolygon    177\ndtype: int64\n\n\nIn this case, we see that the dat layer contains Polygon and MultiPolygon geometries.\n\n\n2.2.4 Geometries\nEach element in the geometry column is a geometry object, of class shapely. For example, here is one specific geometry selected by implicit index (that of Canada):\n\ndat[\"geometry\"].iloc[3]\n\n\n\n\nand here is a specific geometry selected based on the \"name_long\" attribute:\n\ndat[dat[\"name_long\"] == \"Egypt\"][\"geometry\"].iloc[0]\n\n\n\n\nThe shapely package is compatible with the Simple Features standard. Accordingly, seven types of geometries are supported. The following section demonstrates creating a shapely geometry of each type, using a string in the WKT format as input. First, we need to import the shapely.wkt module:\n\nimport shapely.wkt as wkt\n\nThen, we use the wkt.loads (stands for “load a WKT string”) to transform a WKT string to a shapely geometry object. Here is an example of a POINT geometry:\n\npoint = wkt.loads(\"POINT (5 2)\")\npoint\n\n\n\n\nHere is an example of a MULTIPOINT geometry:\n\nmultipoint = wkt.loads(\"MULTIPOINT ((5 2), (1 3), (3 4), (3 2))\")\nmultipoint\n\n\n\n\nHere is an example of a LINESTRING geometry:\n\nlinestring = wkt.loads(\"LINESTRING (1 5, 4 4, 4 1, 2 2, 3 2)\")\nlinestring\n\n\n\n\nHere is an example of a MULTILINESTRING geometry:\n\nmultilinestring = wkt.loads(\"MULTILINESTRING ((1 5, 4 4, 4 1, 2 2, 3 2), (1 2, 2 4))\")\nmultilinestring\n\n\n\n\nHere is an example of a POLYGON geometry:\n\npolygon = wkt.loads(\"POLYGON ((1 5, 2 2, 4 1, 4 4, 1 5), (2 4, 3 4, 3 3, 2 3, 2 4))\")\npolygon\n\n\n\n\nHere is an example of a MULTIPOLYGON geometry:\n\nmultipolygon = wkt.loads(\"MULTIPOLYGON (((1 5, 2 2, 4 1, 4 4, 1 5)), ((0 2, 1 2, 1 3, 0 3, 0 2)))\")\nmultipolygon\n\n\n\n\nAnd, finally, here is an example of a GEOMETRYCOLLECTION geometry:\n\ngeometrycollection = wkt.loads(\"GEOMETRYCOLLECTION (MULTIPOINT (5 2, 1 3, 3 4, 3 2), LINESTRING (1 5, 4 4, 4 1, 2 2, 3 2))\")\ngeometrycollection\n\n\n\n\nshapely geometries act as atomic units of vector data, as spatial operations on a geometry return a single new geometry. For example, the following expression calculates the difference between the buffered multipolygon (using distance of 0.1) and itself:\n\nmultipolygon.buffer(0.2).difference(multipolygon)\n\n\n\n\nInternally, many spatial operations on a geometry column (or a vector layer) are basically iterations where the operator is applied on all geometries, one by one, to return a new geometry column (or layer) with the combined results.\nAs demonstrated above, a shapely geometry object is automatically evaluated to a small image of the geometry (when using an interface capable of displaying it, such as a Jupyter Notebook). To print the WKT string instead, we can use the print function:\n\nprint(linestring)\n\nLINESTRING (1 5, 4 4, 4 1, 2 2, 3 2)\n\n\nWe can determine the geometry type using the .geom_type property, which is a string:\n\nlinestring.geom_type\n\n'LineString'\n\n\nFinally, it is important to note that raw coordinates of shapely geometries are accessible through a combination of the .coords, .geoms, .exterior, and .interiors, properties (depending on the geometry type). These access methods are useful for when we need to develop our own spatial operators for specific tasks. For example, the following expression returns the coordinates of the polygon geometry exterior (note that the returned object is iterable, thus enclosed in a list to return all coordinates at once):\n\nlist(polygon.exterior.coords)\n\n[(1.0, 5.0), (2.0, 2.0), (4.0, 1.0), (4.0, 4.0), (1.0, 5.0)]"

    "section": "2.3 Raster data",
    "text": "2.3 Raster data\n\n2.3.1 Introduction\nAs mentioned above, working with rasters in Python is less organized around one comprehensive package (such as the case for vector layers and geopandas). Instead, there are several packages providing alternative (subsets of methods) of working with raster data.\nThe two most notable approaches for working with rasters in Python are provided by the rasterio and xarray packages. As we will see shortly, they differ in their scope and underlying data models. Specifically, rasterio represents rasters as numpy arrays associated with a separate object holding the spatial metadata. The xarray package, however, represents rasters with the native DataArray object, which is an extension of numpy array designed to hold axis labels and attributes, in the same object, together with the array of raster values.\nBoth packages are not comprehensive in the same way as geopandas is. For example, when working with rasterio, on the one hand, more packages may be needed to accomplish (commonly used) tasks such as zonal statistics (package zonalstats) or calculating topographic indices (package richdem). On the other hand, xarray was extended to accommodate spatial operators missing from the core package itself, with the rioxarray and xarray-spatial packages.\nIn the following two sections, we introduce the two well-established packages, rasterio and xarray, which form the basis for most raster functionality in Python. Using any of the add-on packages, or the extensions, should be straightforward, once the reader is familiar with the basics.\n\n\n2.3.2 Using rasterio\nTo work with the rasterio package, we first need to import it. We also import numpy, since (as we will see shortly), the underlying raster data are stored in numpy arrays. To effectively work with those we therefore expose all numpy functions. Finally, we import the show function from the rasterio.plot sub-module for quick visualization of rasters.\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport rasterio\nfrom rasterio.plot import show\nimport subprocess\n\nRasters are typically imported from existing files. When working with rasterio, “importing” a raster is actually a two-step process:\n\nFirst, we open a raster file “connection”, using rasterio.open\nSecond, we read raster values from the connection using the .read method\n\nThis kind of separation is analogous to basic Python functions for reading from files, such as open and .readline to read from a text file. The rationale is that we do not always want to read all information from the file into memory, which is particularly important as rasters size can be larger than RAM size. Accordingly, the second step (.read) is selective. For example, we may want to read just one raster band rather than reading all band.\nIn the first step, to create a file connection, we pass a file path to the rasterio.open function. For this example, we use a single-band raster representing elevation in Zion National Park:\n\nsrc = rasterio.open(\"data/srtm.tif\")\n\nTo get a first impression of the raster values, we can plot it using the show function:\n\nshow(src);\n\n\n\n\nThe “connection” object contains the raster metadata, that is, all of the information other than the raster values. Let us examine it:\n\nsrc.meta\n\n{'driver': 'GTiff',\n 'dtype': 'uint16',\n 'nodata': 65535.0,\n 'width': 465,\n 'height': 457,\n 'count': 1,\n 'crs': CRS.from_epsg(4326),\n 'transform': Affine(0.0008333333332777796, 0.0, -113.23958321278403,\n        0.0, -0.0008333333332777843, 37.512916763165805)}\n\n\nImportantly, we can see:\n\nThe raster data type (dtype)\nRaster dimensions (width, height, and count, i.e., number of layers)\nRaster Coordinate Reference System (crs)\nThe raster affine transformation matrix (transform)\n\nThe last item (i.e., transform) deserves a few more words. To position a raster in geographical space, in addition to the CRS we must specify the raster origin (\\(x_{min}\\), \\(y_{max}\\)) and resolution (\\(delta_{x}\\), \\(delta_{y}\\)). In the transform matrix notation, these data items are stored as follows:\nAffine(delta_x, 0.0, x_min,\n       0.0, delta_y, y_max)\nNote that, by convention, raster y-axis origin is set to the maximum value (\\(y_{max}\\)) rather than the minimum, and, accordingly, the y-axis resolution (\\(delta_{y}\\)) is negative.\nThe .read method of a raster file connection object is used to read the last but not least piece of information: the raster values. Importantly, we can read:\n\nA particular layer, passing a numeric index (as in .read(1))\nA subset of layers, passing a list of indices (as in .read([1,2]))\nAll layers (as in .read())\n\nNote that the layer indices start from 1 contrary to the Python convention of the first index being 0.\nThe resulting object is a numpy array, with either two or three dimensions:\n\nThree dimensions, when reading all layers or more than one layer (e.g., .read() or .read([1,2])). In such case, the dimensions pattern is (layers, rows, columns)\nTwo dimensions, when reading one specific layer (e.g., .read(1))\n\nFor example, let us read the first (and only) layer from the srtm.tif raster, using the file connection object src:\n\ns = src.read(1)\ns\n\narray([[1728, 1718, 1715, ..., 2654, 2674, 2685],\n       [1737, 1727, 1717, ..., 2649, 2677, 2693],\n       [1739, 1734, 1727, ..., 2644, 2672, 2695],\n       ...,\n       [1326, 1328, 1329, ..., 1777, 1778, 1775],\n       [1320, 1323, 1326, ..., 1771, 1770, 1772],\n       [1319, 1319, 1322, ..., 1768, 1770, 1772]], dtype=uint16)\n\n\n\n\n2.3.3 Using xarray\n…\n\nimport xarray as xr\n\nReading:\n\nx = xr.open_dataset(\"data/absolute_v5.nc\")\nx\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<xarray.Dataset>\nDimensions:  (time: 12, lon: 72, lat: 36)\nCoordinates:\n  * time     (time) float64 0.5 1.5 2.5 3.5 4.5 5.5 6.5 7.5 8.5 9.5 10.5 11.5\n  * lon      (lon) float32 -177.5 -172.5 -167.5 -162.5 ... 167.5 172.5 177.5\n  * lat      (lat) float32 -87.5 -82.5 -77.5 -72.5 -67.5 ... 72.5 77.5 82.5 87.5\nData variables:\n    tem      (time, lat, lon) float32 -26.6 -27.4 -25.2 ... -29.4 -29.3 -29.4\nAttributes:\n    CDI:                       Climate Data Interface version ??

    "title": "Appendix A — Installing R and RStudio",
    "section": "A.1 How to Download and Install R",
    "text": "A.1 How to Download and Install R\nR is maintained by an international team of developers who make the language available through the web page of The Comprehensive R Archive Network. The top of the web page provides three links for downloading R. Follow the link that describes your operating system: Windows, Mac, or Linux.\n\nA.1.1 Windows\nTo install R on Windows, click the “Download R for Windows” link. Then click the “base” link. Next, click the first link at the top of the new page. This link should say something like “Download R 3.0.3 for Windows,” except the 3.0.3 will be replaced by the most current version of R. The link downloads an installer program, which installs the most up-to-date version of R for Windows. Run this program and step through the installation wizard that appears. The wizard will install R into your program files folders and place a shortcut in your Start menu. Note that you’ll need to have all of the appropriate administration privileges to install new software on your machine.\n\n\nA.1.2 Mac\nTo install R on a Mac, click the “Download R for Mac” link. Next, click on the R-3.0.3 package link (or the package link for the most current release of R). An installer will download to guide you through the installation process, which is very easy. The installer lets you customize your installation, but the defaults will be suitable for most users. I’ve never found a reason to change them. If your computer requires a password before installing new progams, you’ll need it here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBinaries Versus Source\n\n\n\nR can be installed from precompiled binaries or built from source on any operating system. For Windows and Mac machines, installing R from binaries is extremely easy. The binary comes preloaded in its own installer. Although you can build R from source on these platforms, the process is much more complicated and won’t provide much benefit for most users. For Linux systems, the opposite is true. Precompiled binaries can be found for some systems, but it is much more common to build R from source files when installing on Linux. The download pages on CRAN’s website provide information about building R from source for the Windows, Mac, and Linux platforms.\n\n\n\n\nA.1.3 Linux\nR comes preinstalled on many Linux systems, but you’ll want the newest version of R if yours is out of date. The CRAN website provides files to build R from source on Debian, Redhat, SUSE, and Ubuntu systems under the link “Download R for Linux.” Click the link and then follow the directory trail to the version of Linux you wish to install on. The exact installation procedure will vary depending on the Linux system you use. CRAN guides the process by grouping each set of source files with documentation or README files that explain how to install on your system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n32-bit Versus 64-bit\n\n\n\nR comes in both 32-bit and 64-bit versions. Which should you use? In most cases, it won’t matter. Both versions use 32-bit integers, which means they compute numbers to the same numerical precision. The difference occurs in the way each version manages memory. 64-bit R uses 64-bit memory pointers, and 32-bit R uses 32-bit memory pointers. This means 64-bit R has a larger memory space to use (and search through).\nAs a rule of thumb, 32-bit builds of R are faster than 64-bit builds, though not always. On the other hand, 64-bit builds can handle larger files and data sets with fewer memory management problems. In either version, the maximum allowable vector size tops out at around 2 billion elements. If your operating system doesn’t support 64-bit programs, or your RAM is less than 4 GB, 32-bit R is for you. The Windows and Mac installers will automatically install both versions if your system supports 64-bit R."

    "section": "A.2 Using R",
    "text": "A.2 Using R\nR isn’t a program that you can open and start using, like Microsoft Word or Internet Explorer. Instead, R is a computer language, like C, C++, or UNIX. You use R by writing commands in the R language and asking your computer to interpret them. In the old days, people ran R code in a UNIX terminal window—as if they were hackers in a movie from the 1980s. Now almost everyone uses R with an application called RStudio, and I recommend that you do, too.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR and UNIX\n\n\n\nYou can still run R in a UNIX or BASH window by typing the command:\n$ R\nwhich opens an R interpreter. You can then do your work and close the interpreter by running q() when you are finished."

    "section": "A.3 RStudio",
    "text": "A.3 RStudio\nRStudio is an application like Microsoft Word—except that instead of helping you write in English, RStudio helps you write in R. I use RStudio throughout the book because it makes using R much easier. Also, the RStudio interface looks the same for Windows, Mac OS, and Linux. That will help me match the book to your personal experience.\nYou can download RStudio for free. Just click the “Download RStudio” button and follow the simple instructions that follow. Once you’ve installed RStudio, you can open it like any other program on your computer—usually by clicking an icon on your desktop.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe R GUIs\n\n\n\nWindows and Mac users usually do not program from a terminal window, so the Windows and Mac downloads for R come with a simple program that opens a terminal-like window for you to run R code in. This is what opens when you click the R icon on your Windows or Mac computer. These programs do a little more than the basic terminal window, but not much. You may hear people refer to them as the Windows or Mac R GUIs.\n\n\nWhen you open RStudio, a window appears with three panes in it, as in Figure A.1. The largest pane is a console window. This is where you’ll run your R code and see results. The console window is exactly what you’d see if you ran R from a UNIX console or the Windows or Mac GUIs. Everything else you see is unique to RStudio. Hidden in the other panes are a text editor, a graphics window, a debugger, a file manager, and much more. You’ll learn about these panes as they become useful throughout the course of this book.\n\n\n\nFigure A.1: The RStudio IDE for R.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo I still need to download R?\n\n\n\nEven if you use RStudio, you’ll still need to download R to your computer. RStudio helps you use the version of R that lives on your computer, but it doesn’t come with a version of R on its own."
