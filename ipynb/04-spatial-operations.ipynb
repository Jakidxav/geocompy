        "\n",
        "The term ‘map algebra’ was coined in the late 1970s to describe a “set of conventions, capabilities, and techniques” for the analysis of geographic raster and (although less prominently) vector data (Tomlin 1994). In this context, we define map algebra more narrowly, as operations that modify or summarise raster cell values, with reference to surrounding cells, zones, or statistical functions that apply to every cell.\n",
        "\n",
        "Map algebra operations tend to be fast, because raster datasets only implicitly store coordinates, hence the old adage “raster is faster but vector is corrector”. The location of cells in raster datasets can be calculated by using its matrix position and the resolution and origin of the dataset (stored in the header). For the processing, however, the geographic position of a cell is barely relevant as long as we make sure that the cell position is still the same after the processing. Additionally, if two or more raster datasets share the same extent, projection and resolution, one could treat them as matrices for the processing.\n",
        "\n",
        "This is the way that map algebra works with the terra package. First, the headers of the raster datasets are queried and (in cases where map algebra operations work on more than one dataset) checked to ensure the datasets are compatible. Second, map algebra retains the so-called one-to-one locational correspondence, meaning that cells cannot move. This differs from matrix algebra, in which values change position, for example when multiplying or dividing matrices.\n",
        "\n",
        "Map algebra (or cartographic modeling with raster data) divides raster operations into four subclasses (Tomlin 1990), with each working on one or several grids simultaneously:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Local or per-cell operations\n",
        "* Focal or neighborhood operations. Most often the output cell value is the result of a 3 x 3 input cell block\n",
        "* Zonal operations are similar to focal operations, but the surrounding pixel grid on which new values are computed can have irregular sizes and shapes\n",
        "* Global or per-raster operations; that means the output cell derives its value potentially from one or several entire rasters\n",
        "\n",
        "This typology classifies map algebra operations by the number of cells used for each pixel processing step and the type of the output. For the sake of completeness, we should mention that raster operations can also be classified by discipline such as terrain, hydrological analysis, or image classification. The following sections explain how each type of map algebra operations can be used, with reference to worked examples.\n",

The neighborhood (also named kernel, filter or moving window) under consideration is typically of size 3-by-3 cells (that is the central cell and its eight surrounding neighbors), but can take on any other (not necessarily rectangular) shape as defined by the user. A focal operation applies an aggregation function to all cells within the specified neighborhood, uses the corresponding output as the new value for the the central cell, and moves on to the next central cell (Figure ...).
